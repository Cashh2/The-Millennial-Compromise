### 🏯 About Me
Hey there! I'm **Henery Cash**, an **American** cybersecurity specialist with a passion for **global policies, foreign affairs, and the evolving cyber landscape**. I graduated from **Indiana University**, and I’m on a mission to shape **cybersecurity at an international level** because digital borders matter just as much as physical ones. 🌍

When I’m not diving into cybersecurity frameworks or quantum computing research, you’ll find me binging my favorite anime, debating power levels, and finding inspiration in the world of **mechs, hackers, and strategic masterminds**. 🚀
